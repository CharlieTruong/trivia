# Simple Trivia Game

This defines an AWS lambda function to handle a simple trivia game as an Alexa skill. The lambda function is updated by zipping the contents of this directory and uploading to the lambda function.

## Potential Future Considerations

* Keep track of number of right and wrong answers
* Use DynamoDB to persist user scores
* Use CloudFormation templates to update the Alexa Skill and Lambda function
* Identify other trivia apis that may offer multiple choice answers
